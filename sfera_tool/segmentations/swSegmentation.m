function changePts = swSegmentation(y, opt)
%SWSEGMENTATION Segments the signal using a sliding-window feature.
%
%   changePts = swSegmentation(y, metric, winLen, overlap)
%
%   This function performs signal segmentation by computing a feature
%   (variance, mean, energy, or RMS) within sliding windows and detecting 
%   significant changes in that feature over time. It is a general-purpose 
%   segmentation method suitable for signals whose statistical properties 
%   evolve gradually or abruptly.
%
%   INPUTS
%       y       : Input signal (vector).
%       opt     : swSegmentationOptions object (optional)
%                  - metric         : feature to compute in each window ('var','mean','energy','rms'), default 'mean'
%                  - winLenFraction : window length as fraction of signal length (default 0.2)
%                  - overlap        : number of overlapping samples between windows (default 0)
%
%   OUTPUT
%       changePts : Estimated change points (indices). The final sample 
%                   index (length(y)) is always appended.
%
%   METHOD OVERVIEW
%   (1) Sliding-window feature extraction
%       The signal is scanned using windows of length winLen, each shifted  
%       by a step equal to:
%
%           step = winLen – overlap
%
%       For each window, the chosen metric is computed, producing a 
%       feature sequence FEAT(k) that summarizes the signal’s behavior 
%       over time.
%
%   (2) Change detection on the feature trajectory
%       Changes are detected by examining the discrete derivative of FEAT:
%
%           abs(diff(FEAT)) > 2 * std(FEAT)
%
%       This threshold identifies windows whose feature value deviates
%       significantly from the typical variations, indicating a 
%       potential transition or change in the underlying behavior.
%
%   (3) Mapping window-based indices to signal indices
%       Detected window indices are converted back to sample indices using:
%
%           changePoint ≈ windowIndex * step
%
%       Duplicates are removed, indices are clipped to the signal length,
%       and the final sample index (N) is appended to ensure full coverage.
%
%   NOTES
%       - This method is useful when changes in *statistics* rather than 
%         amplitude alone mark transitions (e.g., noise bursts, drifting 
%         mean, energy changes).
%       - It is more flexible than derivative-based segmentation, but 
%         depends on window length and metric selection.
%       - Larger windows create smoother feature trends (fewer segments);
%         smaller windows increase sensitivity but may add noise.
